## Why are we doing this ?

Flutter doesn't allow you to compare objects on a value basis, but reference so if you have 2 classes from the same parent of the same values they are still not identifical

Also copying an object is a pain in the ass

And serialization is even worse

But this library helps you a lot by killing a lot of the repetition
